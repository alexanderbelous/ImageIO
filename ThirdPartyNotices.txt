Software: libjpeg-turbo
Owner: D. R. Commander and Viktor Szathmáry
Source URL: github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo
License: IJG License and Modified (3-clause) BSD License
Text:
   libjpeg-turbo Licenses
   ======================

   libjpeg-turbo is covered by two compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

   - The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
     [README.ijg](README.ijg)

     This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs,
     including any code inherited from libjpeg and any modifications to that
     code.  Note that the libjpeg-turbo SIMD source code bears the
     [zlib License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Zlib), but in the context of
     the overall libjpeg API library, the terms of the zlib License are subsumed
     by the terms of the IJG License.

   - The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

     This license applies to the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs, as
     well as the build system.  Note that the TurboJPEG API library wraps the
     libjpeg API library, so in the context of the overall TurboJPEG API library,
     both the terms of the IJG License and the terms of the Modified (3-clause)
     BSD License apply.


   Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
   =========================================

   This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
   best of our understanding.  This is not a license in and of itself.  It is
   intended solely for clarification.

   1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
       then:

       1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
           from the source.

           **Origin**
           - Clause 1 of the IJG License
           - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License
           - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License

       2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
           file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file.  (If
           there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
           simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

           **Origin**
           - Clause 1 of the IJG License
           - Clause 2 of the zlib License

       3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
           copyright or license text in that file.

           **Origin**
           - Clause 1 of the IJG License

   2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
       if you are distributing an application that statically links with
       libjpeg-turbo, then:

       1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

           This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
           Group.

           **Origin**
           - Clause 2 of the IJG license

       2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then
           your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD
           License (see below.)

           **Origin**
           - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

   3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
       contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

       **Origin**
       - IJG License
       - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

   4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be
       free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable
       consequences resulting from your use of the software.

       **Origin**
       - IJG License
       - Modified BSD License
       - zlib License

   Why Two Licenses?
   =================

   The zlib License could have been used instead of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
   License, and since the IJG License effectively subsumes the distribution
   conditions of the zlib License, this would have effectively placed
   libjpeg-turbo binary distributions under the IJG License.  However, the IJG
   License specifically refers to the Independent JPEG Group and does not extend
   attribution and endorsement protections to other entities.  Thus, it was
   desirable to choose a license that granted us the same protections for new code
   that were granted to the IJG for code derived from their software.
